abstract = {In this paper, we focus on the challenging perception problem in robotic pouring. Most of the existing approaches either leverage visual or haptic information. However, these techniques may suffer from poor generalization performances on opaque containers or concerning measuring precision. To tackle these drawbacks, we propose to make use of audio vibration sensing and design a deep neural network PouringNet to predict the liquid height from the audio fragment during the robotic pouring task. PouringNet is trained on our collected real-world pouring dataset with multimodal sensing data, which contains more than 3000 recordings of audio, force feedback, video and trajectory data of the human hand that performs the pouring task. Each record represents a complete pouring procedure. We conduct several evaluations on PouringNet with our dataset and robotic hardware. The results demonstrate that our PouringNet generalizes well across different liquid containers, positions of the audio receiver, initial liquid heights and types of liquid, and facilitates a more robust and accurate audio-based perception for robotic pouring.},

abstract = {This paper presents an advanced control system in a tilting ladle type automatic pouring system. To improve the productivity and save energy, in the pouring process, it is important that the mould be filled precisely and quickly with molten metal. A sequence control employing prediction of filling weight is proposed in this paper. In the proposed control system, the sequence parameter varies depending on the predicted filling weight during the back tilting. The proposed control system has an advantage in that it can be performed by common control equipment such as a programmable logical controller. The effectiveness of the proposed filling weight control system is demonstrated through the experiments using water. {\textcopyright} 2008 W. S. Maney {\&} Son Ltd.},

abstract = {Robust and accurate estimation of liquid height lies as an essential part of pouring tasks for service robots. However, vision-based methods often fail in occluded conditions while audio-based methods cannot work well in a noisy environment. We instead propose a multimodal pouring network (MP-Net) that is able to robustly predict liquid height by conditioning on both audition and haptics input. MP-Net is trained on a self-collected multimodal pouring dataset. This dataset contains 300 robot pouring recordings with audio and force/torque measurements for three types of target containers. We also augment the audio data by inserting robot noise. We evaluated MP-Net on our collected dataset and a wide variety of robot experiments. Both network training results and robot experiments demonstrate that MP-Net is robust against noise and changes to the task and environment. Moreover, we further combine the predicted height and force data to estimate the shape of the target container.},

We propose both a model-based and a model-free method utilizing deep learning for estimating the volume of liquid in a container. Our results show that the model-free method is better able to estimate the volume. We combine this with a simple PID controller to pour specific amounts of liquid, and show that the robot is able to achieve an average 38ml deviation from the target amount. To our knowledge, this is the first use of raw visual feedback to pour liquids in robotics.},

abstract = {Pouring is one of the most commonly executed tasks in humans' daily lives, whose accuracy is affected by multiple factors, including the type of material to be poured and the geometry of the source and receiving containers. In this work, we propose a self-supervised learning approach that learns the pouring dynamics, pouring motion, and outcomes from unsupervised demonstrations for accurate pouring. The learned pouring model is then generalized by self-supervised practicing to different conditions such as using unaccustomed pouring cups. We have evaluated the proposed approach first with one container from the training set and four new but similar containers. The proposed approach achieved better pouring accuracy than a regular human with a similar pouring speed for all five cups. Both the accuracy and pouring speed outperform state-of-the-art works. We have also evaluated the proposed self-supervised generalization approach using unaccustomed containers that are far different from the ones in the training set. The self-supervised generalization reduces the pouring error of the unaccustomed containers to the desired accuracy level.},

abstract = {Robot learning from demonstration faces new challenges when applied to tasks in which forces play a key role. Pouring liquid from a bottle into a glass is one such task, where not just a motion with a certain force profile needs to be learned, but the motion is subtly conditioned by the amount of liquid in the bottle. In this paper, the pouring skill is taught to a robot as follows. In a training phase, the human teleoperates the robot using a haptic device, and data from the demonstrations are statistically encoded by a parametric hidden Markov model, which compactly encapsulates the relation between the task parameter (dependent on the bottle weight) and the force-torque traces. Gaussian mixture regression is then used at the reproduction stage for retrieving the suitable robot actions based on the force perceptions. Computational and experimental results show that the robot is able to learn to pour drinks using the proposed framework, outperforming other approaches such as the classical hidden Markov models in that it requires less training, yields more compact encodings and shows better generalization capabilities. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},
