abstract = {LAURI V{\"{A}}LIMAA: MQTT client implementation in IEC 61131-3 compatible programming environment Tampere University of Technology Master of Science Thesis, 60 pages, 0 Appendix pages In this work IoT-Ticket's device support is to be expanded so that CODESYS (COntroller DEvelopment SYStem) compatible devices can be used as valid data sources for this system in the future. CODESYS enabled devices are primarily programmable logic controllers (PLC) that are used to control various industrial processes in different environments. CODESYS itself is a manufacturer independent programming environment which is compatible with IEC 61131-3 standard. Support for CODESYS enabled devices was required to be developed using MQTT (Mes-sage Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol. MQTT is open application level protocol based on publish-subscribe messaging pattern. In addition to this, it was also required that the data which is sent to IoT-Ticket must be encrypted when it is transferred over unse-cure communication channel. Both of these requirements were achieved with MQTT client which was developed for CODESYS in this work. Data encryption in developed client was implemented using symmetric encryption.},
